/*
	The reason you don't get you wanted results is because when you declare an array pointer (int* pArr[])
	it's kind of a pointer of pointers, so when you print each element it's printing a pointer.
	but when you have a 2d array it's stored as a big array in one big line, in a 2d array there are no pointers as elements.
